# Godot Lua PluginScript

<img src="blog/icon.png" alt="Lua PluginScript icon" width="128" height="128"/>

GDNative + PluginScript library that adds support for [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)
as a scripting language in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

Being a GDNative library, recompiling the engine is not required, so anyone
with a built release copied to their project can use it.
Being a PluginScript language, Lua can seamlessly communicate with scripts
written in GDScript / C# / Visual Script and vice-versa.
This way, one can use the language that best suits the implementation for each
script and all of them can understand each other.

This plugin is available in the Asset Library as [Lua PluginScript](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1078)
and has [online documentation](https://gilzoide.github.io/godot-lua-pluginscript/topics/README.md.html).

For some usage examples, check out [lps\_coroutine.lua](lps_coroutine.lua)
and [plugin/lua\_repl.lua](plugin/lua_repl.lua).

Currently, only LuaJIT is supported, since the implementation is based on its
[FFI](https://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html) library.


## Installing

Either:

- In Godot Editor, open the [Asset Library tab](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/assetlib/using_assetlib.html#in-the-editor),
  search for the [Lua PluginScript](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1078)
  asset, download and install it.
- Put a built release of the library into the project folder and restart Godot.
  Make sure the `lua_pluginscript.gdnlib` file is located at the
  `res://addons/godot-lua-pluginscript` folder.
- Clone this repository as the project's `res://addons/godot-lua-pluginscript`
  folder and build for the desired platforms.


## Project Settings + Plugin

In the `Project -> Project Settings...` window, some settings are available:

- **Lua PluginScript/Package Path/Behavior**: Whether templates will replace
  [package.path](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-package.path),
  be appended to it or prepended to it.
  Default behavior: `replace`.
- **Lua PluginScript/Package Path/Templates**: String array of templates to be
  injected into `package.path`.
  Default templates: `res://?.lua` and `res://?/init.lua`.
- **Lua PluginScript/Package C Path/Behavior**: Whether templates will replace
  [package.cpath](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-package.cpath),
  be appended to it or prepended to it.
  Default behavior: `replace`.
- **Lua PluginScript/Package C Path/Templates**: String array of templates to be
  injected into `package.cpath`.
  Default templates: `!/?.dll` and `!/loadall.dll` on Windows, `!/?.so` and `!/loadall.so` elsewhere.
- **Lua PluginScript/Export/Minify On Release Export**: Whether Lua scritps
  should be minified on release exports.
  Defaults to `true`.

Also, an editor plugin is included, currently with a barebones REPL for Lua
expressions, located in the bottom panel of the editor.
Enable the `Lua PluginScript` plugin in the `Plugins` tab of the Project Settings window.


## Using LuaRocks

Lua modules available at [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) can be installed locally to the project:

```
luarocks install --lua-version 5.1 --tree <local modules folder name> <module name>
```

Adjust the package paths using the settings described above and Lua PluginScript
should be able to `require` the installed modules.


## Goals

- Provide support for Lua as a scripting language in Godot in a way that does
  not require compiling the engine from scratch
- Be able to seamlessly communicate with any other language supported by Godot,
  like GDScript, Visual Script and C#, in an idiomatic way
- Simple script description interface that doesn't need `require`ing anything
- Support for LuaJIT and Lua 5.2+
- Support paths relative to `res://*` and exported game/app executable path for
  `require`ing Lua modules
- Have a simple build process, where anyone with the cloned source code and
  installed build system + toolchain can build the project in a single step


## Non-goals

- Provide calls to all core Godot classes' methods via native method bindings
- Support multithreading on the Lua side

## Script example

This is an example of how a Lua script looks like.

```lua
-- Class definitions are regular Lua tables, to be returned from the script
local MyClass = {}

-- Optional: set class as tool, defaults to false
MyClass.is_tool = true

-- Optional: set base class by name, defaults to 'Reference'
MyClass.extends = 'Node'

-- Optional: give your class a name
MyClass.class_name = 'MyClass'

-- Declare signals
MyClass.something_happened = signal()
MyClass.something_happened_with_args = signal("arg1", "arg2")

-- Values defined in table are registered as properties of the class
-- By default, properties are not exported to the editor
MyClass.some_prop = 42

-- The `property` function adds metadata to defined properties,
-- like setter and getter functions
MyClass.some_prop_with_details = property {
  -- ["default_value"] or ["default"] or [1] = property default value
  5,
  -- ["type"] or [2] = variant type, optional, inferred from default value
  -- All Godot variant type names are defined globally as written in
  -- GDScript, like bool, int, float, String, Array, Vector2, etc...
  -- Notice that Lua <= 5.2 does not differentiate integers from float
  -- numbers, so we should always specify `int` where appropriate
  -- or use `int(5)` in the default value instead
  type = int,
  -- ["get"] or ["getter"] = getter function or method name, optional
  get = function(self)
    return self.some_prop_with_details
  end,
  -- ["set"] or ["setter"] = setter function or method name, optional
  set = 'set_some_prop_with_details',
  -- ["usage"] = property usage, from `enum godot_property_usage_flags`
  -- optional, default to `PropertyUsage.NOEDITOR`
  usage = PropertyUsage.NOEDITOR,
  -- ["hint"] = property hint, from `enum godot_property_hint`
  -- optional, default to `PropertyHint.NONE`
  hint = PropertyHint.RANGE,
  -- ["hint_string"] = property hint text, only required for some hints
  hint_string = '1,10',
  -- ["rset_mode"] = property remote set mode, from `enum godot_method_rpc_mode`
  -- optional, default to `RPCMode.DISABLED`
  rset_mode = RPCMode.MASTER,
}
-- The `export` function is an alias for `property` that always exports
-- properties to the editor
MyClass.exported_prop = export { "This property appears in the editor" }
MyClass.another_exported_prop = export {
  [[This one also appears in the editor,
now with a multiline TextArea for edition]],
  hint = PropertyHint.MULTILINE_TEXT,
}

-- Functions defined in table are public methods
function MyClass:_ready()  -- `function t:f(...)` is an alias for `function t.f(self, ...)`
  -- Singletons are available globally
  local os_name = OS:get_name()
  print("MyClass instance is ready! Running on a " .. os_name .. " system")
end

function MyClass:set_some_prop_with_details(value)
    self.some_prop_with_details = value
    -- Indexing `self` with keys undefined in script will search base
    -- class for methods and properties
    self:emit_signal("something_happened_with_args", "some_prop_with_details", value)
end

function MyClass:get_some_prop_doubled()
  return self.some_prop * 2
end

-- In the end, table with class declaration must be returned from script
return MyClass
```

The API is documented using [LDoc](https://stevedonovan.github.io/ldoc/manual/doc.md.html).
Documentation may be generated with the following command:

```sh
make docs
```


## Building

This project uses git submodules for its dependencies, so be sure to activate
submodules before building.

```sh
# clone this repository and activate submodules in a single command
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-lua-pluginscript.git

# or clone it normally and then activate submodules
git clone https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-lua-pluginscript.git
cd godot-lua-pluginscript
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Build using [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) from project root,
specifying the system as target:

```sh
# Choose one of the supported platforms, based on your operating system
make windows64  # x86_64
make windows32  # x86
make linux64    # x86_64
make linux32    # x86
make osx64 \    # multiarch x86_64 + amd64 dylib
    # Optional: deployment target. If absent, uses 10.7 for x86_64 and 11.0 for arm64
    MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=XX.YY \
    # Optional: code sign identity. If absent, `codesign` is not performed
    CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=<identity> \
    # Optional: additional flags passed to `codesign`
    OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS=<flags>
    
# Cross-compiling for Windows using MinGW
make mingw-windows64  # x86_64
make mingw-windows32  # x86

# Cross-compiling for Android using NDK
make android-armv7a \   # Android ARMv7
    NDK_TOOLCHAIN_BIN=/path/to/ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuild/host_os-arch/bin   
make android-aarch64 \  # Android ARM64
    NDK_TOOLCHAIN_BIN=/path/to/ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuild/host_os-arch/bin  
make android-x86 \      # Android x86
    NDK_TOOLCHAIN_BIN=/path/to/ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuild/host_os-arch/bin      
make android-x86_64 \   # Android x86_64
    NDK_TOOLCHAIN_BIN=/path/to/ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuild/host_os-arch/bin   

# Cross-compiling for iOS in a OSX environment
make ios64 \    # Dylibs for iOS arm64 and simulator arm64 + x86_64
    # Optional: minimum iOS version to target. If absent, uses 8.0
    IOS_VERSION_MIN=X.Y
    # Optional: code sign identity. If absent, `codesign` is not performed
    CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=<identity> \
    # Optional: additional flags passed to `codesign`
    OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS=<flags>
```

If you plan in using the export plugin, the following is also required:

```sh
make plugin
```

The GDNativeLibrary file `lua_pluginscript.gdnlib` is already configured to use
the built files stored in the `build` folder, so that one can use this
repository directly inside a Godot project under the folder `addons/godot-lua-pluginscript`.

After building the desired libraries, a distribution zip can be built with:

```sh
make dist
```
